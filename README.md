# Recovery Methodologies: Regularization and Sampling

Notes on recovery methodologies: regularization and sampling

[Linear Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares)

Recovery questions arise in applied mathematics when one needs to recover something- a function, a signal, or an image â€“ from partial or incomplete information.  Such problems, often described as inverse problems, are usually ill-posed and often difficult to resolve.
